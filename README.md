## Runtime complexities

1. ReverseString: linear => O(n)
2. printing Steps (the iterative, for loop solution): Quadratic => O(n^2)
3. printing Pyramid (the iterative, for loop solution): Quadratic => O(n^2)
4. Nth Fibonacci number
   -- (iterative solution): O(n),
   -- (recursive solution): exponential => 2^n
   -- (memoized solution): O(n),
5. Queue (using JS array) is FIFO
   -- enqueue (add at the end): O(1)
   -- dequeue (remove from start): O(n)
6. Stack (using JS array) is LIFO or FILO
   -- push (add at the end): O(1)
   -- pop (remove from the end): O(1)
7. LinkedList
   -- add
