## Runtime complexities

1. ReverseString: linear => O(n)
2. printing Steps (the iterative, for loop solution): Quadratic => O(n^2)
3. printing Pyramid (the iterative, for loop solution): Quadratic => O(n^2)
4. Nth Fibonacci number
   -- (iterative solution): O(n),
   -- (recursive solution): exponential => 2^n
   -- (memoized solution): O(n),
